A calculator for calculating tips
This is my second challenge practice from
Frontend mentor
It is an app that help clients to 
easily calculate tips after purchase
It gives both default percentage calculations
as well as custom alternatives.
It allows user to specify the bill, tip percentage
and number of people.
It gives the total amount for an individual as well as
total tip amount

In all, the app is responsive.

Frontend mentor has indeed provided for me and
many other a very good platform to put into practice
what we learn.

Thank you so much
